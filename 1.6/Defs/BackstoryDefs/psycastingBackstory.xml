    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] was built by an imperial research project in an effort to create the perfect royal guard android. [PAWN_pronoun] was programmed with extensive military knowledge and the secrets of imperial psycasters. However, [PAWN_possessive] distinguishing feature is 
    the custom frame enhancing psychic resonance. But before the critical component, a core of Eltex coils, could be manufactured, the project lost all funding and [PAWN_nameDef] was abandoned.</baseDesc>
